It’s razor thin, feather light, and even faster and more powerful than before. It has the brightest, most colourful Mac notebook
display ever. And it features the Touch Bar — a Multi-Touch–enabled strip of glass built into the keyboard for instant access to
the tools you want, just when you want them. MacBook Pro is built on groundbreaking ideas. And it’s ready for yours.

The Touch Bar replaces the function keys that have long occupied the top of your keyboard with something much more versatile and
capable.2 It changes automatically based on what you’re doing to show you relevant tools you already know how to use — system
controls like volume and brightness, interactive ways to adjust or browse through content, intelligent typing features like emoji
and predictive text, and more. And now Touch ID is available on a Mac, enabling instant access to logins and fast, secure online
purchases with Apple Pay.

YOUR FAVOURITE APPS. NOW WITH TOUCH BAR.
The Touch Bar can change how you experience the apps you use every day — like Photoshop, Microsoft Office, DaVinci Resolve, Logic
Pro X and others. Key tools and features appear on the Touch Bar, so they’re easier to discover and use. It’s a dynamic canvas
that developers can use to add a new dimension of interactivity to current and future apps.

PERFORMANCE SPEED-OF-THE-ART.
MacBook Pro elevates the notebook to a whole new level of performance and portability. Wherever your ideas take you, you’ll get
there faster than ever with cutting-edge graphics, high-performance processors, super-smart storage and more.

The 15-inch MacBook Pro features a powerful Radeon Pro discrete GPU in every configuration. Manufactured with a 14nm process,
Radeon Pro graphics combine outstanding power with outstanding power efficiency. And now 4GB of GDDR5 memory comes as standard on
the top configuration, giving you fluid, real-time performance for pro tasks like rendering 3D titles in Final Cut Pro X. Every
13-inch model features powerful integrated graphics with 64MB of embedded DRAM, which accelerates graphics tasks. That means more
time for what matters most — creating amazing work.

SNAP.
MacBook Pro includes a solid-state drive that’s incredibly fast, with sequential read speeds up to 3.2GB/s. The 15-inch model is
available with up to a 2TB SSD — enough space to take even your biggest projects with you, without having to take an external
drive. And its memory is both high speed and power efficient. It all works together to help you boot up, launch multiple apps or
import huge files in a flash.

PROCESSORS THAT PROVIDE INCREDIBLE POWER. AND USE INCREDIBLY LITTLE.
With seventh-generation Intel Core processors, MacBook Pro delivers amazing performance, with Turbo Boost frequencies up to
4.1GHz. So you can move fast — even when powering through pro-level processing jobs like rendering 3D models and encoding video.
At the same time, it can conserve energy when taking on lighter tasks, like browsing the web and checking email. And 10-bit HEVC
hardware acceleration comes as standard on MacBook Pro, which will let you take even more advantage of the boosts in 4K video
compression and streaming performance in macOS High Sierra.

13-inch and 15-inch models.1 So you’re free to keep watching, gaming and editing from wherever you are.

The thinner the notebook, the less space for cooling. So MacBook Pro incorporates innovations throughout the system that
efficiently eliminate heat — increasing airflow during intensive tasks like editing video, playing graphics-heavy games and
transferring huge files.

On the 15-inch MacBook Pro, an innovative split blade design allows for more blades and delivers increased airflow. The
asymmetrical layout of the fan blades reduces noise.

RETINA DISPLAY THE BRIGHTEST, MOST COLOURFUL MAC NOTEBOOK DISPLAY EVER.
The display in the MacBook Pro is the best ever in a Mac notebook. It features bright LED backlighting and a high contrast ratio,
delivering deep blacks and bright whites. Its large pixel aperture and variable refresh rate make it power efficient. And it
supports wide colour for even more vibrant greens and reds than with sRGB. This makes for more true-to-life pictures with
realistically vivid details — essential for graphic design, colour grading and editing.

range of greens and reds.

AUDIO SPEAKERS THAT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. LOUDLY.
13-inch model with Touch Bar Replay

Enjoy beautifully balanced, high-fidelity sound that takes listening to new levels with wide dynamic range and more bass for
maximum boom. The speakers are connected directly to system power, enabling greater peak amplification. So they make MacBook Pro
the perfect choice for mixing a track on the fly, editing video on location or enjoying a film on the go.

KEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD MORE RESPONSIVE KEYBOARD. MORE EXPANSIVE TRACKPAD.
Interacting with MacBook Pro is a smooth experience all round. The keyboard features our second-generation butterfly mechanism —
providing four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism, along with greater comfort and responsiveness. And
the spacious Force Touch trackpad gives your fingers plenty of room to gesture and click.

THUNDERBOLT 3 OUR MOST POWERFUL
AND VERSATILE PORT EVER.
Thunderbolt 3 combines ultra-high bandwidth with the ultra-versatility of the USB-C industry standard to create one revved-up
universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging and video output in a single connector, delivering up to 40Gb/s of
throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. Both sizes of MacBook Pro are available with four ports, so you can do all
that from either side. Existing devices are easily connected with a cable or adapter. And Thunderbolt 3 is reversible, so no
matter how you plug in, it’s always the right way up.

    2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5–based 13-inch MacBook Pro systems with a 1TB SSD and 8GB of RAM; pre-production 3.1GHz
    dual-core Intel Core i5–based 13-inch MacBook Pro systems with a 512GB SSD and 8GB of RAM; and pre-production 2.8GHz quad-core
    Intel Core i7–based 15-inch MacBook Pro systems with a 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. The wireless web test measures battery life
    by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. The iTunes film
    playback test measures battery life by playing back HD 1080p content with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or
    75%. The standby test measures battery life by allowing a system, connected to a wireless network and signed in to an iCloud
    account, to enter standby mode with Safari and Mail applications launched and all system settings left at default. Battery
    life varies by use and configuration. See www.apple.com/uk/batteries [/uk/batteries/] for more information.

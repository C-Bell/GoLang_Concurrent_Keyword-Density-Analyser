CONSTITUENCY PROFILE[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=SHEFFIELD_HALLAM_(UK_PARLIAMENT_CONSTITUENCY)&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=1]]
It has returned a Labour MP for the first time since its first election in 1885 and, apart from a brief period between 1916 and
1918, was held by the Conservatives from 1885 until 1997, when the Liberal Democrats won it. This long period of Conservative
dominance included all 3 elections under Margaret Thatcher's premiership [/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher%27s_premiership], starkly
contrasting with the consensus within most seats in the county and the other county which Sheffield Hallam borders, Derbyshire
[/wiki/Derbyshire].

In a 2013 survey by The Campaign to End Child Poverty, Sheffield Hallam was found to be the constituency with the lowest level of 
child poverty [/wiki/Child_poverty] in the UK, at under 5%.[3]

On income-based 2004 statistics, this is the most affluent constituency one place below the top ten seats of the 650, which were
spread across the South East of England [/wiki/South_East_of_England] (including London [/wiki/Greater_London]), with almost 12%
of residents earning over £60,000 a year.[4] This measure placed Sheffield Hallam above Windsor
[/wiki/Windsor_(UK_Parliament_constituency)] and Twickenham [/wiki/Twickenham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)].

Based on 2011–12 income and tax statistics from HMRC [/wiki/HMRC],[5] Sheffield Hallam has the 70th highest median income of the
650 parliamentary constituencies, with those above it almost exclusively in London and the South East, and placing it above
Tunbridge Wells (76th), The Cotswolds (92nd), Cambridge (97th), Hemel Hempstead (103rd), and David Cameron's former Witney
constituency (121st).

The 2001 Census showed Hallam to have the highest number of people classified as professionals of any of the UK constituencies.[6] 
Furthermore, 60% of working age residents hold a degree,[7] 7th highest and exceeding Cambridge
[/wiki/Cambridge_(UK_Parliament_constituency)].[n 2]

Prior to the 1997 general election [/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997], the constituency was a safe Conservative
[/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)] seat, and was the only Conservative seat in South Yorkshire in the three previous elections to
that. From 2005 to 2017, it was represented in the House of Commons [/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom] by Nick Clegg
[/wiki/Nick_Clegg], who was leader of the Liberal Democrats [/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)] from 2007 to 2015 and Deputy Prime
Minister [/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom] from 2010 to 2015.

Hallam constituency extends from Stannington [/wiki/Stannington_(ward)] and Loxley [/wiki/Loxley,_South_Yorkshire] in the north to 
Dore [/wiki/Dore] in the south and includes small parts of the city centre in the east. It includes the wards of Crookes
[/wiki/Crookes], Dore and Totley [/wiki/Dore_and_Totley], Ecclesall [/wiki/Ecclesall], Fulwood [/wiki/Fulwood,_South_Yorkshire] 
and Stannington.

The majority of Hallam is rural, spreading in the west into the Peak District [/wiki/Peak_District] National Park
[/wiki/National_parks_of_England_and_Wales]. It also contains some of the least deprived wards in the country, has low
unemployment (1.5% jobseekers claimants in November 2012)[8] and a high rate of owner occupancy with few occupants who rent their
home.[9] Since the 2010 boundary changes [/wiki/Fifth_Periodic_Review_of_Westminster_constituencies], neither of Sheffield's
universities have a campus in the constituency[10] but it still includes areas where many students live.[citation needed
[/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]

In the 2017 general election, the Labour party candidate, Jared O'Mara, won the seat from Clegg.[2] This is the first time in the
seat's history that it has returned a Labour MP.

HISTORY[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=SHEFFIELD_HALLAM_(UK_PARLIAMENT_CONSTITUENCY)&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=3]]
Prior to its creation Hallam was a part of the larger Sheffield Borough constituency
[/wiki/Sheffield_(UK_Parliament_constituency)], which was represented by two Members of Parliament [/wiki/Member_of_Parliament] 
(MPs). In 1885 the Redistribution of Seats Act [/wiki/Redistribution_of_Seats_Act_1885], which sought to eliminate constituencies
with more than one MP and for the first time allow approximately equal representation of the people, led to the break-up of the
constituency into five divisions: each represented by a single MP, as today. Hallam was one of these new divisions. Its first MP,
the Conservative Charles Stuart-Wortley [/wiki/Charles_Stuart-Wortley,_1st_Baron_Stuart_of_Wortley], had previously been an MP in
the Sheffield constituency, elected for the first time in 1880.

Hallam was regarded in 2004 as the wealthiest constituency in the north of England[4] and was long held by the Conservative Party
[/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)]. At the 1997 general election [/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997] Richard Allan
[/wiki/Richard_Allan,_Baron_Allan_of_Hallam] of the Liberal Democrats took the seat with an 18.5% swing [/wiki/Swing_(politics)].

At the 2017 General Election the constituency recorded its highest turnout since 1951, with 77.8% of voters going to the polls.

CONSTITUENCY POLLS DURING THE 2010–2015 PARLIAMENT[EDIT
[/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=SHEFFIELD_HALLAM_(UK_PARLIAMENT_CONSTITUENCY)&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=4]]
Due in part to the high profile of the constituency's then-MP Nick Clegg, who served as Deputy Prime Minister during the 2010–15
Parliament, Sheffield Hallam is unusual in having had seven constituency-specific opinion polls conducted between 2010 and 2015.
Each of these polls suggested significant changes in the vote share compared to 2010 general election. The first poll, in October
2010, suggested a drop in the Lib Dem lead in the seat to just 2%, from nearly 30% at the general election five months earlier.
Five of the six remaining polls, which appeared between May 2014 and May 2015, suggested that Labour was in the lead in the seat
by this time, with the Labour lead fluctuating to between 1% and 10%, and one put the Lib Dems in the lead. On average across all
seven opinion polls, Labour had a lead over the Lib Dems of 2.5%. The Conservatives came second in one poll, and third in the
other six polls. It should be noted that the May 2015 ICM poll scores displayed are those of the constituency voting intention
question. The same poll also carried the standard voting intention question, which showed a Labour lead.[11][12][13][14][15][16]

on polling day leading to some people being unable to cast their vote. In this case, voters at the Ranmoor polling station were
subjected to long queues and some voters were turned away when polls closed at 10 pm, with Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Clegg
apologising to those voters affected. Acting Returning Officer John Mothersole said that staff had been "caught out" by a high
turnout, and the Electoral Commission [/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)] instigated a review of procedures in Hallam
and other constituencies where similar problems had occurred.[26]

 2.  ^ Also above Cities of London and Westminster [/wiki/Cities_of_London_and_Westminster_(UK_Parliament_constituency)] and 
     Hammersmith and Fulham [/wiki/Hammersmith_and_Fulham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)].
 3.  ^ The constituency should not be confused with the former Hallamshire constituency

 4.  ^ Knighted in 1928 and appointed Governor of Bombay [/wiki/Governor_of_Bombay]
 5.  ^ At the 1997 general election [/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997] the seat saw an unprecedented 18.2% one-party
     swing [/wiki/Swing_(politics)] from the other parties, particularly the large Conservative vote, towards the Liberal Democrat
     winning candidate.
 6.  ^ After 28 years as MP for the seat, John Osborn stood down at the 1987 general election

     Patnick, held the seat for the Conservatives with a slightly reduced majority.
 7.  ^ Clive Betts [/wiki/Clive_Betts], the losing Labour candidate at the October 1974 general election

 9.  ^ The constituency boundaries were redrawn prior to the February 1974 general election
     [/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974], perhaps accounting for the reduced majority of the incumbent, John
     Osborn.

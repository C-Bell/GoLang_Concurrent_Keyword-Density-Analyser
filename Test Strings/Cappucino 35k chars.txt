Italian pronunciation:[kapputˈtʃiːno] [/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian] Italian plural cappuccini) is an Italian coffee [/wiki/Coffee] 
drink [/wiki/Beverage] that is traditionally prepared with double espresso [/wiki/Espresso], and steamed milk foam [/wiki/Foam].

Variations of the drink involve the use of cream [/wiki/Cream] instead of milk, and flavouring with cinnamon [/wiki/Cinnamon] or 
chocolate [/wiki/Chocolate] powder.[1][2] It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte [/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_latte], with a
thicker layer of micro foam.

The name comes from the Capuchin [/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin] friars, referring to the colour of their habits
[/wiki/Religious_habit],[3] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to
dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk
is a result of a long evolution of the drink.

The Viennese [/wiki/Vienna] bestowed the name "Kapuziner" possibly in the 18th century on a version that included whipped cream
and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of
Viennese-style cafés in Trieste [/wiki/Trieste] and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century.
The drink has since spread worldwide and can be found at a number of establishments.

DEFINITION[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=1]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Cappuccino_3.jpg/220px-Cappuccino_3.jpg] [/wiki/File:Cappuccino_3.jpg] 
[/wiki/File:Cappuccino_3.jpg]A cup of CappuccinoCappuccino is a coffee drink that today is composed of double espresso and hot
milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk.[1] Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine
[/wiki/Espresso_machine]. The double espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk,
which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of
milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art [/wiki/Latte_art].

In a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffee houses [/wiki/Coffeehouse] in the United States, the total of
espresso and milk/foam make up between approximately 150–180 ml (5–6 imp fl oz; 5–6 US fl oz). Commercial coffee restaurant chains
in the US more often serve the cappuccino as a 360 ml (13 imp fl oz; 12 US fl oz) drink or larger.

Cappuccino is traditionally small (max 180 ml) with a thick layer of foam, while 'latte' traditionally is larger (200 ml-300 ml).
Caffè latte is often served in a large glass; cappuccino mostly in a 150 – 180 ml cup with a handle. Cappuccino traditionally has
a layer of textured milk micro foam exceeding 1 cm in thickness; micro foam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so
small and so numerous that they are not seen, but it makes the milk lighter and thicker. As a result, the micro foam will remain
partly on top of the mug when the espresso is poured in correctly as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.

The World Barista Championships [/wiki/World_Barista_Championship] have been arranged annually since 2000, and during the course
of the competition, the competing barista must produce—for four sensory judges—among other drinks four cappuccinos, defined in WBC
Rules and Regulations as [...] a coffee and milk beverage that should produce a harmonious balance of rich, sweet milk and
espresso [....] The cappuccino is prepared with one (1) single shot of espresso, textured milk and foam. A minimum of 1 centimeter
of foam depth [....] A cappuccino is a beverage between 150 ml and 180 ml in total volume [....][4]

ETYMOLOGY[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=2]]
'Cappuccino' comes from Latin Caputium, later borrowed in German/Austrian and modified into 'kapuziner'. It is the diminutive form
of cappuccio in Italian [/wiki/Italian_language], meaning 'hood' or something that covers the head, thus 'cappuccino' reads 'small
capuchin'. It is believed the capuchin friar, Marco d'Aviano [/wiki/Marco_d%27Aviano], was the inspiration for this beverage.[5]

The coffee beverage has its name not from the hood but from the colour of the hooded robes worn by monks and nuns of the Capuchin
order. This colour is quite distinctive and 'capuchin' was a common description of the colour of red-brown in 17th century Europe.
The Capuchin monks chose the particular design of their orders' robes both in colour and shape of the hood back in the 16th
century, inspired by Francis of Assisi [/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi]'s preserved 13th century vestments. The long and pointed hood was
characteristic and soon gave the brothers the nickname 'capuchins' (hood-wearing). It was, however the choice of red-brown as the
order's vestment colour that, as early as the 17th century, saw 'capuchin' used also as a term for a specific colour. While
Francis of Assisi humbly used uncoloured and un-bleached wool for his robes, the capuchins coloured their vestments to differ from
Franciscans, Benedictines, Augustinians and other orders.

The word 'Cappuccino' in its Italian form is not known in Italian writings until the 20th century, but the German language
'Kapuziner' is mentioned as a coffee beverage in the 18th century in Austria, and is described as 'coffee with sugar, egg yolks
and cream' in dictionary entries from 1800 onwards. "Kapuziner" was by the First World War [/wiki/First_World_War] a common coffee
drink in cafés in the parts of northern Italy which at that time still belonged to Austria.

The use of fresh milk in coffee in cafés and restaurants is a newer phenomenon (from the 20th century) when refrigeration became
common. The use of full cream is known much further back in time (but not in the use as whipped cream [chantilly] ), as this was a
product more easily stored and frequently used also in cooking and baking. Thus, a 'Kapuziner' was prepared with a very small
amount of cream to get the 'capuchin' colour. Today, 'Kapuziner' is still served in viennese traditional cafés: still black coffee
with only a few drops of cream (in some establishments developed into a capå of whipped cream).

HISTORY AND EVOLUTION[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=3]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Cappuccino_at_Sightglass_Coffee.jpg/220px-Cappuccino_at_Sightglass_Coffee.jpg]
[/wiki/File:Cappuccino_at_Sightglass_Coffee.jpg] [/wiki/File:Cappuccino_at_Sightglass_Coffee.jpg]Cappuccino with heart decoration
The consumption of coffee in Europe was initially based on the traditional Ottoman [/wiki/Ottoman_Empire] preparation of the
drink, by bringing to boil the mixture of coffee and water together, sometimes adding sugar. The British seem to have started
filtering and steeping coffee already in the second part of the 18th century[6] and France and continental Europe followed suit.
By the 19th century coffee was brewed in different devices designed for both home and public cafés.

Adding milk to coffee is mentioned by Europeans already in the 1700s,[6] and sometimes advised.[6]

'Cappuccino' originated as the coffee beverage "Kapuziner" in the Viennese coffee houses in the 1700s at the same time as the
counterpart coffee beverage named "Franziskaner": 'Kapuziner' shows up on coffee house menus all over the Habsburg Monarchy
[/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy] around this time, and is in 1805 described in a Wörterbuch (dictionary) as 'coffee with cream and sugar'
(although it does not say how it is composed). 'Kapuziner' is mentioned again in writings in the 1850s, described as 'coffee with
cream, spices and sugar'.[7] Around the same time, the coffee beverage 'Melange' is mentioned in writings, explained as a blend of
coffee and milk, presumably similar to the modern day 'Caffè Latte [/wiki/Latte]'. Other coffees containing cream surfaced in 
Vienna [/wiki/Vienna], and outside Austria these are referred to as 'Viennese Coffee' or 'Café Viennois', coffee with whipped
cream. Predecessors of Irish Coffee [/wiki/Irish_Coffee], sweetened coffee with different alcohols, topped with whipped cream also
spread out from Vienna.

The 'Kapuziner' took its name from the colour of coffee with a few drops of cream, nicknamed so because the capuchin monks in
Vienna and elsewhere wore vestments with this colour.[8] Another popular coffee was Franziskaner, with more cream, referring to
the somewhat 'lighter' brown colour of the robes of monks of the Franciscan [/wiki/Franciscan] order.

Cappuccino as we write it today (in Italian) is first mentioned in northern Italy in the 1930s, and photographs from that time
shows the drink to resemble a 'viennese' —a coffee topped with whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon or chocolate. The Italian
cappuccino evolved and developed in the following decades: The steamed milk atop is a later addition, and in the US a slight
misunderstanding has led to this 'cap' of milk foam being named 'monk's head' -although it originally had nothing to do with the
name of the beverage.

Though coffee was brewed differently all over Europe after the Second World War [/wiki/Second_World_War], in Italy, the real
espresso machines became widespread only during the 1950s, and 'cappuccino' was redefined, now made from espresso and frothed milk
(though far from the quality of micro foam steamed milk today). As the espresso machines improved, so did the dosing of coffee and
the heating of the milk. Outside Italy, 'cappuccino' spread, but was generally made from dark coffee with whipped cream, as it
still is in large parts of Europe even in 2014.

The 'Kapuziner' remained unchanged on the Austrian coffee menu, even in Trieste [/wiki/Trieste], which by 1920 belonged to Italy
and in Budapest [/wiki/Budapest], Prague [/wiki/Prague], Bratislava [/wiki/Bratislava] and other cities of the former empire.

Espresso machines [/wiki/Espresso_machine] were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, after Luigi Bezzera of Milan
[/wiki/Milan] filed the first patent [/wiki/Patent] in 1901,[9] and although the first generations of machines certainly did not
make espresso the way we define it today.

Coffee making in cafés changed in the first decades of the 20th century. These first machines made it possible to serve coffee
'espresso' -specifically to each customer. The cups were still the same size, and the dose of beans were ground coarse as before.
The too high temperature of the boilers scalded the coffee and several attempts at improving this came in the years after the
First World War.

By the end of the Second World War, the Italians launched the 'age of crema' as the new coffee machines could create a higher
pressure, leading to a finer grind and the now classic 'crema'.

The first small cups appear in the 1950s, and the machines could by now also heat milk. The modern 'cappuccino' was born.[citation
needed [/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]][10] In Vienna, the espresso bars were introduced in the 1950s, leading to both the
'kapuziner' and the by now new-born Italian 'cappuccino' being served as two different beverages alongside each other.

In the United Kingdom, espresso coffee initially gained popularity in the form of the cappuccino, influenced by the British custom
of drinking coffee with milk, the desire for a longer drink to preserve the café as a destination, and the exotic texture of the
beverage.[11]

INGREDIENTS[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=4]]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Cappuccino_2.jpg/220px-Cappuccino_2.jpg] [/wiki/File:Cappuccino_2.jpg] 
[/wiki/File:Cappuccino_2.jpg]Make from Illy [/wiki/Illy] Coffee of Cappuccino with cream in coffee shop.As cappuccino is defined
today, in addition to a double shot of espresso a most important factor in preparing a cappuccino is the texture and temperature
of the milk. When a barista [/wiki/Barista] steams the milk for a cappuccino, microfoam [/wiki/Microfoam] is created by
introducing very tiny bubbles of air into the milk, giving the milk a velvety texture. The traditional cappuccino consists of a
single espresso, on which the barista pours the hot foamed milk, resulting in a 2 cm (3⁄4in) thick milk foam on top. Variations
could be made adding another shot of espresso resulting in a double cappuccino. Attaining the correct ratio of foam requires close
attention while steaming the milk, thus making the cappuccino one of the most difficult espresso-based beverages to make properly.
A skilled barista may obtain artistic shapes [/wiki/Latte_art] while pouring the milk on the top of the espresso coffee.

POPULARITY[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=5]]
Cappuccino was traditionally a taste largely appreciated in Europe [/wiki/Europe], Australia [/wiki/Australia], South America
[/wiki/South_America] and some of North America [/wiki/North_America]. By the mid-1990s cappuccino was made much more widely
available to North Americans, as upscale coffee houses sprang up.

In Italy, and throughout continental Europe, cappuccino was traditionally consumed early in the day as part of the breakfast, with
some kind of sweet pastry [/wiki/Pastry]. Generally, Europeans did not drink cappuccino with meals other than breakfast. Though
they did prefer to drink Espresso [/wiki/Espresso] after dinner.[citation needed [/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]][12] However,
in recent years Europeans have started to drink cappuccino throughout the entire day. Especially in Australia and Western Europe
[/wiki/Western_Europe] (The UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain) cappuccino is popular at cafés and
terraces during the afternoon and in restaurants after dinner. In modern-day Italy, cappuccino is consumed only up to 11 a.m., and
Italians consider it very strange to ask for a cappuccino after that hour. If the beverage is requested in the evening, although
not common, it should only be consumed after dessert, as the final part of the meal. Espresso is usually ordered after a meal due
to the belief that the lack of milk aids in digestion.[13] In the United States, cappuccinos have become popular concurrent with
the boom in the American coffee industry through the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially in the urban Pacific Northwest
[/wiki/Pacific_Northwest].[14]

Cappuccino is traditionally served in 150–180 ml (5–6 imp fl oz; 5–6 US fl oz) cups. By the start of the 21st century, a modified
"short-cut" version was being served by fast-food chains in servings up to 600 ml (21 imp fl oz; 20 US fl oz).

PREPARATION[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=6]]
TRADITIONAL AND LATTE ART[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=7]]

[/wiki/File:Cappuccino_Chiang_Mai.JPG] [/wiki/File:Cappuccino_Chiang_Mai.JPG]Cappuccino coffee with latte art [/wiki/Latte_art] 
rosetta.Although size is what varies most among different cappuccinos, there are two main ways of preparing cappuccino: one is the
traditional or classical way with a cap of milk foam; the other is the "Latte Art" way. The former follows the traditional idea of
the cappuccino being prepared by ⅓ espresso, ⅓ steamed milk and ⅓ milk foam. The latter follows the same recipe, but is served
more often in smaller cups, and the textured milk is gently poured in and finished with a pattern in the surface crèma. The
illustrations in this article show the preparation methods.[15][16]

ICED CAPPUCCINO[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=8]]
In Canada, Tim Hortons [/wiki/Tim_Hortons]'s coffee chain sells iced coffee [/wiki/Iced_coffee] cappuccino under the brand name
Iced Capps. The coffee drink mix comes to the Tim Hortons stores as a thick black syrup which is mixed at three parts water to one
part syrup in a slurpee [/wiki/Slurpee] machine. The frozen coffee drink is then blended with cream at the time of service (or
blended with milk, or chocolate milk upon customer request). The Ice Capp can also be prepared as a Supreme, which includes a
flavour shot, whipped topping, and either caramel or chocolate syrup. There is also a Brownie Supreme, which is made with
chocolate milk, and mixed with bits of brownie. This is then topped with whipped topping, and finished off with more bits of
brownie scattered on top. The chain has also recently introduced traditional iced coffee to its Canadian menu in addition to its
U.S. menu.

CAPUCCINO FREDDO[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=9]]
In Cyprus [/wiki/Cyprus] and Greece [/wiki/Greece], the iced cappuccino is widespread, known locally as Freddo Cappuccino, as
opposed to Cappuccino Freddo. Despite its Italian name, the drink both tastes and is prepared differently to its Italian
counterpart, and is not common in Italy or outside Greece. The Freddo Cappuccino is topped with a cold milk-based foam known as
aphrogala (Greek [/wiki/Greek_language]: αφρόγαλα), which is created using cold milk and an electric frother. These frothers are
commonplace in Greek coffeeshops due to their usage during the preparation of Frappé coffee [/wiki/Frapp%C3%A9_coffee]. The foam
is then added to espresso poured over ice.[citation needed [/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] [17] Outside Greece and Cyprus,
Capuccino Freddo can be mostly found on coffee shops and delis catering towards the Greek expat community. More recently, 
Starbucks [/wiki/Starbucks] has added Cappuccino Freddo to branch menus in Europe. [18]

ICED COFFEE[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=10]]
Main article: Iced coffee [/wiki/Iced_coffee]Cappuccino Freddo is the cold version of a cappuccino, and the drink usually has a
small amount of cold frothed milk atop it. This drink is widely available in Cyprus, Greece, and parts of Italy. In Rome, for
example, each bar has the drink already prepared. In cities of Northern Italy [/wiki/Northern_Italy], like Milan, however, it is
almost impossible to find cappuccino freddo. Instead, gelato da bere (a thick blend of gelato [/wiki/Gelato] and espresso) or 
shakerato (espresso and ice shaken together) are more popular. The term has also spread throughout the Mediterranean region
[/wiki/Southern_Europe] where foam is added to the drink just before serving, often varying from the Italian original.

In North America, however, the terms "Cappuccino Freddo" or "Iced cappuccino", if offered, may be somewhat of a misnomer if the
characteristic frothed milk is omitted in the iced variation. For example, at Starbucks [/wiki/Starbucks], without the frothed
milk the drink is called an "iced latte [/wiki/Latte]".

SIMILAR DRINKS[EDIT [/W/INDEX.PHP?TITLE=CAPPUCCINO&ACTION=EDIT&SECTION=11]]
Other milk and espresso drinks similar to the cappuccino include:

 * Caffè macchiato [/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_macchiato] (sometimes called espresso macchiato) is a significantly shorter drink, which
   consists of espresso with only a small amount of milk.
 * Cortado [/wiki/Cortado] is a Spanish hybrid; a slightly shorter drink, which consists of espresso mixed with milk in a 1:1 to
   1:2 ratio, and is not topped with foam. Cafè Cortado has traditionally been served in a small glass on a saucer, and its
   character comes more from the Spanish preference of coffee beans and roast plus condensed milk [/wiki/Condensed_milk] replacing
   fresh dairy milk. Modern coffee shops have started using fresh milk.
 * Flat White [/wiki/Flat_White] is a hybrid which is popular in Australia and New Zealand. It is in-between a cappuccino and a
   caffè latte ('flat' indicating little or no foam), typically prepared with a double shot of espresso and a little latte art
   atop. A flat white is prepared with a milder espresso and no robusta.
 * Latte [/wiki/Latte] (short for "caffè latte") is a larger drink, with the same amount of espresso, but with more milk and a
   varying amount of foam, served in a large cup or tall glass.
 * A steamer or babyccino is a drink of frothed milk [/wiki/Milk] without coffee (hence no caffeine [/wiki/Caffeine]), which is
   available in some coffeehouses [/wiki/Coffeehouse]. In North America it often has flavoured syrup [/wiki/Syrup] added, while in
   Commonwealth countries outside North America it is primarily marketed to children[19] as a coffee [/wiki/Coffee]-free
   cappuccino, as the name indicates, and is sometimes topped with marshmallows, a chocolate flake [/wiki/Flake_(chocolate_bar)],
   or sprinkles.

THE CAPPUCCINO IS DISAPPEARING? THANK GOD - IT'S HORRIBLE
THE NEWS THAT STARBUCKS IS PHASING OUT CAPPUCCINOS IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF BEULAH DEVANEY, WHO SAYS NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD ORDER IT
Cappuccino drink [https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03330/cappuccinomain_3330696b.jpg]Starbucks is phasing out
the cappuccino in US storesPhoto: Alamy By Beulah Devaney

1:56PM BST 05 Jun 2015

 Ah, the cappuccino. It sounds so good on paper, doesn't it? Espresso, hot milk and plenty of froth, with an optional dusting of
chocolate on top. But in most chain coffee shops, a cappuccino means a sickly chocolate crust, burnt milk and bitter espresso
dregs. Mmm. 

 Thankfully, the drink's days might be numbered. According to reports, coffee giant Starbucks is starting to phase out its
cappuccinos
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11653608/Ciao-cappuccino-Starbucks-replaces-coffee-with-the-flat-white.html] 
in favour of trendy newcomer the flat white, and I am among those fervently hoping that UK branches adopt the same policy. I’m not
a crazy coffee snob (this entire feature has been fuelled by out-of-date Nescafe because I can’t be bothered to clean the
cafetiere, and the coffee machine is making a weird moaning sound), so I say this with compassion, love and respect for the UK’s
coffee-drinkers: it’s time to grow up and accept that the cappuccino has run dry. (Or wet, if you’re drinking those milky American
abominations). 

 Once upon a time, back when men wore spats and people ate whelks in the cinema, the cappuccino was sophisticated. It was the kind
of thing one sipped while watching a leggy blonde ride a leopard down the Champs-Élysées. And, when made properly, it can be a
pleasant enough drink. The problem is that your average coffee chain doesn't take the time. 

 [https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03330/flatwhiteembed_3330699b.jpg]

 Upstart: the flat white (ALAMY) 

 “Cappuccinos are a massive chore to make,” says Lydia, an ex-Starbucks 'Coffee Master'. “You have to froth the milk a certain way
and then 'free pour' rather than using a spoon. Then every cappuccino has to be weighed to determine that it is the right weight
and not too heavy/wet or too light/dry”. 

 All of which is fine if you can make the time to lovingly craft every individual coffee like a Swiss clockmaker with a surfeit of
cogs and cuckoos. But for a barista dealing with the screaming morning rush at Liverpool Street Station, it’s easy to see why most
cappuccinos are terrible. Not only are you torturing yourself every time you order a cappuccino, you are also torturing the person
opposite you who actually takes pride in their work and wish they could give you a decent coffee. 

 This shift away from the cappuccino isn’t just a case of customers giving up on the bitter mess that lurks beneath two inches of
sour milk, however. “The demise is mostly down to the flat white phenomenon,” says Ashlee Quinn, a Coffee Roaster at the
independent Extract Coffee Roasters in Bristol. “The flat white is the same size [as the cappuccino] but with a smooth velvety
textured milk. It has to be steamed to an optimum temperature to achieve this, and often comes with an attractive pattern in the
pour. It results in a pleasant drink that integrates the espresso in a more harmonious way.” 

 

 Aren’t all those words lovely? Don’t just you just want to drift away on a “harmonious”, “integrated”, “velvety” coffee? Rather
than being dragged into the hellmouth by a scorched, bitter cappuccino with abandonment issues? Even if Starbucks decide to keep
cappuccino on the menu, let’s stop torturing ourselves. Walk away from the cappuccino, Britain. We’ve been suckling on this foamy
teat for far too long.

[ ]HOW TO PREPARE CAPPUCCINO AT HOME
Myth: cappuccino’s silky magic is beyond the grasp of home baristas. It’s just too delicate of a dance, best left to the cafe.

Truth: great cappuccino is a delight available to discerning coffee lovers, right in their own kitchens. It takes some practice
with water, steam and foam, along with the right equipment on your countertop. You’ll want an espresso machine with a built-in 
steaming wand. And of course, illy coffee on hand as your foundation.

A cappuccino is an approximately 150 ml (5 oz) beverage, with 25 ml of espresso coffee and 85ml of fresh milk The foaming action
creates the additional volume.

[/wps/wcm/connect/b9185a6f-b118-48ba-80c6-c3e0e78c7630/come-preparare-cappuccino-in-cas_modulo_2_4_colonne.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=b9185a6f-b118-48ba-80c6-c3e0e78c7630]
FOR A CAPPUCCINO AT ITS BEST:
 * Pour cold milk into a metal steaming pitcher, about a third full
 * Release steam from the steaming wand for two seconds to eliminate any residual water
 * Dip the tip of the steaming wand into milk and start the jet. As the foam rises and the volume of milk increases, lower the
   pitcher, always keeping the tip submerged and tilted to create a vortex. Do not mix unnecessarily (i.e. let the natural
   circulating action do the work)
 * Continue steaming until the milk reaches 65 degrees (check via probe-style kitchen thermometer) and its volume doubles
 * Tap the base of the pitcher firmly on the countertop to compress the foam
 * Prepare an espresso in a large cup (ideally, a cappuccino cup)
 * Pour the foamed milk directly into the cup, first aiming for the center, then continuing in a circular motion out toward the
   rim
 * Operate the steam one more time to eliminate any remaining milk residue

Un consiglio per il cappuccino [/wps/wcm/connect/2c7a99ff-ff17-42ec-a714-b5f6a86e6a6f/come-preparare-cappuccino-in-casa_3_modulo_2_4_colonne_.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=2c7a99ff-ff17-42ec-a714-b5f6a86e6a6f]
THE BEST FOAM
Foam’s consistency depends on the milk’s fat content.
For the most velvety, rich cappuccino, use whole milk. You can substitute low-fat milk, at the sacrifice of some smoothness.
Foam produced from skim milk is light and meringue-like, quick to dissolve.

[https://www.diffen.com/difference/Category:Beverages] Cappuccino and latte (also called Caffè latte) are the two most popular Italian coffee drinks and are both prepared using hot
milk. The difference is that cappuccino is prepared with less steamed or textured milk than caffe latte. In a cappuccino the total 
espresso [/difference/Coffee_vs_Espresso] and milk/foam makes up roughly 6 oz in a 12 oz drink.

[/difference/Image:Whey_Protein.jpg]Cappuccino [https://data.diffen.com/Cappuccino] with Whey Protein
[https://data.diffen.com/Whey_Protein]A latte is made up of coffee and hot steamed milk. The coffee can be replaced with another
drink base like tea, mate or matcha. In Italy caffè latte is often prepared at home for breakfast. The coffee is brewed on
stovetop Moka or caffettiera and poured into a cup containing heated milk. The Italian latte does not contain foamed milk. Outside
Italy, caffe latte is made up of 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk; a 5 mm layer of foamed milk floats on top. Another version of
latte is made with strong or bold coffee mixed with scalded milk in the ratio of 1:1. Though this is similar to a Cappuccino, the
milk foam layer is of 2 cm in a Cappuccino.

Cappuccinos are prepared with espresso [/difference/Coffee_vs_Espresso], hot milk, and steamed milk foam. The texture and 
temperature [/difference/Heat_vs_Temperature] of milk is of prime importance. Milk is steamed to introduce tiny air bubbles into
the milk; this creates what is known as micro foam and gives the milk a smooth texture and sweetness. The hot foamed milk is
poured into the espresso which results in a 2 cm thick milk foam layer on top. Cappuccino has variations that make use of more
milk, such as the cappuccino chiaro, or white cappuccino, and the cappuccino scuro, or dry cappuccino. Cappuccino Freddo is the
cold version of the coffee drink and is usually topped with small amount of cold, frothed milk.

With the advent of single-serve coffeemakers, such as Nespresso [/difference/Keurig_vs_Nespresso] and Tassimo
[/difference/Keurig_vs_Tassimo], making lattes and cappuccinos at home has become easier in recent years, requiring less careful
attention.



ORIGIN OF LATTE AND CAPPUCCINO
Terms caffè and latte were first used in 1847 and later in 1867 they appeared in William Dean Howells essay "Italian Journeys".
Latte originally means milk in Italian and the caffè version of this drink is an American invention. Caffè latte originated in
Caffè Mediterraneum, a café in Berkeley, California and was brewed in its current form by Lino Meiorin for the first time. He
added more milk to this otherwise strong cappuccino and called this new drink "caffè latte".

Cappuccino in commercial form was introduced at the beginning of 20th century, when patented espresso machines were introduced by
Luigi Bezzera of Milan in 1901. These machines made the cappuccino very popular in cafes and restaurants and the current from
developed by the 1950s.

[/difference/Image:Caffe-Latte.jpg]More Latte ArtLatte art refers to the style of pouring steamed milk into the espresso and
create a pattern or design on surface of resulting latte. This can be achieved by embellishing the top layer of foam. The art is
difficult to be created consistently and is dependent on experience of barista and quality of espresso machine. To pour is the
challenge of the latte artist.

if you ask for a latte in Italy you'll get a glass of milk, not surpisingly!

I'm astonished that you can believe that Latte was invented in America. People were drinking it in Europe before America was even
discovered.

Caffelatte IS Italian. It is what we have at home, because you can have steamed milk foam only with a professional coffee
equipment so our home cappuccino is actually a caffelatte. And adding some coffee to the morning latte is something every young
people do for their daily breakfast. 
As for the information I read that a cappuccino is served in a glass, honestly I don't know where this came from.... I've been
living in Italy my whole life and I've never had a cappuccino in a glass. They are always served in a big porcelain cup, bigger
than the little one we have our coffee (which is ALWAYS an expresso)

everyone serving cappucinos should know of its origin and meaning.
cappucino friars bold head on top and brown hair all around : )
Too much reheated and spooned over foam is not acceptable

[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/7bbf6a07-4d15-4d47-a7ac-4cacc0f1e4d4.png] HIGH QUALITY COFFEE 
Only the best beans make the grade to becoming coffee masterpieces for NESCAFE Dolce Gusto. 

They’re picked to perfection, dried in the sun, fermented and peeled before they get anywhere near your cup, all to create a
coffee masterpiece. 

NO MESS NO FUSS 
Our coffee pods are sealed after the roast has been ground to deliver to you a delicious aroma and full flavour. The coffee grinds
stay in the pod so there is virtually no cleaning either, however a wipe down of the machine and rinse of the capsule holder every
few weeks is recommended. 

BAR PRESSURE 
Create coffee shop quality coffee with our maximum 15 bar pump pressure machine. Our high pressure system produces velvety cremas
and frothy coffees, like you find in your local coffee shop. 

MULTI BEVERAGE SYSTEM 
Enjoy over 30 delicious coffee creations ranging from classic Espressos and full-bodied Grandes, to frothy Cappuccinos, hot
chocolate, teas and more.

COMPARING TWO FAVORITES
April 8, 2016 HOME [/] Taste & Drinks [/column/taste-drinks/] Cappuccino vs. Latte No comparison of espresso drinks would be
complete without the cappuccino and latte. Each is Italian in origin and made with espresso and milk. But the differences are
created through one important function: barista craft.


[https://dg9f2badvburd.cloudfront.net/media/1912pike/2016/07/06/cappuccino-vs-latte.jpg]At the height of a barista's craft lies
the cappuccino. Dark, rich espresso lies in wait under a smoothed and stretched layer of thick foam. Trained to know when each
drink has reached a specific weight, our baristas pass the test when the drink you hold in your hand is a perfect balance of light
and airy foam and deeply delicious espresso.

With the layers more distinct, the coffee flavor is strong.

Baristas craft the latte in a very different way. The layers of espresso and steamed milk are mixed together and topped with a
light layer of foam. The drink is creamier and the coffee flavor is more subtle.

CAPPUCCINO 
NOUNPLURAL CAPPUCCINOS
 * A type of coffee made with espresso and milk that has been frothed up with pressurized steam.
   
   Example sentences *  ‘We were sitting in a coffee shop, sipping cappuccinos and eating pastries.’
    *  ‘Stuart's final words were to compare the match to a cappuccino - all froth and no substance.’
    *  ‘The muffins are homemade (the low-fat raspberry and the lemon and poppyseed are standouts), and the coffee, especially
      lattés and cappuccinos, is fabulous.’
    *  ‘Worth a trip if only to sample the cappuccino in the coffee shop!’
    *  ‘They have all the expected coffee combos - the lattes, cappuccinos and all sorts of stuff to squirt in them.’
    *  ‘Meanwhile the price of the cappuccinos and lattes in the high street coffee bars, and of coffee on the supermarket
      shelves, remains as high as ever.’
    *  ‘I feel so left out when, gallivanting about town, I see the happy throngs of customers queuing for lattes and mocha
      cappuccinos.’
    *  ‘The froth of their decaffeinated cappuccinos seemed to flutter aerobically in the light breeze.’
    *  ‘Breakfast is available in the morning as well as light snacks, coffees, cappuccinos and teas throughout the day.’
    *  ‘During my day-shifts, in between making countless cappuccinos and lattes, I would talk to the customers and ask them what
      they do.’
    *  ‘Behind the counter employees served up fresh coffees and cappuccinos, hot chocolates and teas, all with a unique line of
      flavoring patented to the owners of the store.’
    *  ‘The drinks are rather expensive, but are usually of good quality (if you like coffee, cappuccinos, and soda pop).’
    *  ‘Three caffeinated cappuccinos, one decaf, one soy latte, a hot chocolate and a caramel-flavored iced latte!’
    *  ‘I don't care though, since I use my dark coffee for lattes and cappuccinos anyway.’
    *  ‘They sipped their espressos and cappuccinos from the coffee shop next door that was practically part of the theatre.’
    *  ‘We ordered coffees, two large cappuccinos at £1.65 each.’
    *  ‘The menu consisted of a few beverages - some alcoholic though mainly just coffees and cappuccinos - and a dessert tray.’
    *  ‘The blends, all from Arabica beans, are fine when mixed with milk in lattes and cappuccinos.’
    *  ‘Their church served donuts, cappuccinos, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea.’
    *  ‘Where smoke was concerned, he was like a person who ate the froth from a cappuccino, but never drank any real coffee.’
   
   

ORIGIN
From Italian, literally ‘Capuchin’, because its colour resembles that of a Capuchin's habit.
